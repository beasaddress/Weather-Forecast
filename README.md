# Weather-Forecast
A five-day weather-forecast app that allows the user to search a city name and be shown the current weather, and the forecast for the next five days. Once a city name is typed in the search and the magnifying glass icon is clicked, the api will fetch the data for the user. In this app, we use two different API's. One fetches the current weather for that city, and one fetches the forecast. The user will also be able to see their search history in the left side bar. That way, they can click the city name and be brought back to that specific city's weather dashboard. The app is programmed so that even if the user searches a city twice, intentionally or unintentionally, it will not be duplicated in the search history list. This creates a clutter free weather dashboard. There are also icons that will pop next to the current weather and forecast that correspond to the search result. i.e. rainy forecast shows a cloud covered with rain. This makes the weather dashboard user friendly for people who may not be familair with english, the metric system, or someone who can't read like a small child.
